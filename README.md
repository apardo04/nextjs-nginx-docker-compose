# nextjs-nginx-docker-compose
This project runs a Docker environment for a Next.js app with NGINX as a reverse-proxy.

Docker will run Next.js with PM2 for app restarting and NGINX in separate containers and have NGINX cache static assets.

# TO RUN:
Either run docker-compose-dev.yml

Or build both images and run docker-compose.yml
